# Sentinel3

Jupyter Notebook created to quickly visualize a Sentinel 3 product in natural colors on a Web Mercator, using netCDF4, Leaflet and mpl_toolkit's Basemap libraries.

Currently, only natural color visualization is supported, using the bands Oa1 - Oa10. Further options might be implemented in the future.
